# üöÑURL Shortener
A simple URL Shortener API

I wrote a simple API for short your links.
With this API you can create your own link shortening service.

# ‚úÖ Installing
Install **Python 3.10 [REQUIRED]**

Create a new virtual environment
`python3.10 -m venv venv`

Switch to virtual enironvment that was created before

Install depedencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Configure `config.py`

> Instruction how to configure config below

Run your application
`uvicorn main:app`

# ‚ôª How to configure `config.py`
Set `mongo_link` to your MongoDB connection link and add at the end "/{your_database}"

Set `domain` to your URL shortening service

# ‚ùó How it works
